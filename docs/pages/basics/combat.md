Combat is obviously going to ensue in most games set in the grim and perilous world of Warhammer, and the Foundry system aims to let you handle it with ease through various automated workflows. 

### Targeting 

Targeting the Tokens you intend to attack is the intended way to handle combat, but it isn't the only way. We'll discuss the advantages and disadvantages of other approaches. 

The easiest way to Target a token is hover over it and press `T`, this will create a targeting reticule around the Token for you. Other users will see a dot with the designated color for your user.

</div>

You can also double-right-click Tokens you don't own to Target them. It's worth noting that since GMs own all Tokens, they cannot use this method. 

## The Flow of Combat

Attacking an Actor is very simple. Target their Token and roll with some Item that does damage. This will generate a normal roll Chat Message as well as a targeting notification.

{: .highlight}
> While you can initiate an Opposed Test with any roll (such as characteristic or skill), only certain Items are capable of doing Damage as a result, like Weapons.
>
> Some users mistakenly just roll **Melee (Basic)** when they want to attack, this won't be able to do damage because the system doesn't know what Weapon you want to attack with. When using a Weapon in the Basic, the system knows to use your 
> Melee (Basic) skill

Now, it's time for the other Actor (the defender), to respond. This can be done with *any* roll. In fact, the next roll performed by the defender, whatever it is, is considered the defensive roll. So to do this, you can simply click on any characteristic, skill, trait, weapon, etc. on the defending Actor. 

However, there are shortcut buttons available on the targeting Chat Message, these are contextual based on what Items the defending Actor has. The name of the Item is shown in the tooltip.

Remember that the attacker and defender are likely separate Users! If the GM uses an Actor to attack a Player's character, that Player can simply roll from their sheet or click the shortcut buttons in chat. 

After completing the defensive roll, you will see the opposed result in chat, and if the attacker won, the damage and the button to apply it. The **Apply Damage** button handles almost all the calculations required, including TB and AP reductions, AP Penetration, Ward saves, and much more.

After applying, you can see the breakdown of modifiers in the result tooltip.
